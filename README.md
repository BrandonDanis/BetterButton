# BetterButton
iOS UIButton framework that facilitates adding beautiful to your projects!  ðŸ”´

In my other projects, I always found myself styling buttons in similar fashion. Therefore I decided to create the BetterButton, which inherits from UIButton but has all the styling already done. Which saves me time and looks very good with no extra code no boilerplate code required!

### Goals
My goals with this are to:
* [X] Button can shake  
* [ ] Button can display a loading icon (`button.displayLoadingIcon()`)
* [ ] Button can display a loading bar in the background
* [ ] Add this project to CocoaPods to allow others to use it as well
